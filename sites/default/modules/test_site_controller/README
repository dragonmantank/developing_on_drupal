Test Site Controller
====================

Test Site Controller shows an example module that can be used with deployments to automatically turn modules on and off,
or do other work, as part of the 'update.php' or 'drush updb' process.

Each hook_update_N() entry will do whatever work is need to turn things on and off, or any additional site modifications,
that are needed for each deploy.
