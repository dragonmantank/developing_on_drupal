Themed Form Demo
================

This module should show off the usage of both hook_theme() and a custom theme_*() function to control the output of a
form.

We define a new route in themed_form_menu() to view the form, at http://localhost:8080/themed-form. This page will show the
customized output of our form. We will just be using drupal_get_form to return our form, to cut down on the amount of
boilerplate code we will need to write, since we are doing no additional processing (other than theming) for the form.

We define two theme entries in themed_form_theme(). One is a template file for us to use to control the output of the
form, and the other is to alert Drupal that we would like to control (ie: override) the output for the form.

When we visit the page, themed_form_form() is ultimately called to get a form definition. When this function returns,
Drupal will pass output of the form to theme_themed_form_form() by virtue of our second entry in themed_form_theme().

Inside that form we can control the output of the form. The uncommented version of the function will take the form
definition and pass it into a template file for handing output, while the commented version will simply use string
concatenation to build the HTML.

We take that built-up HTML and return it, and Drupal will use that for the output.
