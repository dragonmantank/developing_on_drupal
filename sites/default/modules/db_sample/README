DB Sample
=========

This module provides a few different examples of code.

In db_sample_menu(), we are now using the 'file' key to tell Drupal where bits of code are located. The forms and admin
functions have been moved to their own file, so we let Drupal know about that.

We've also introduced using 'drupal_get_form' as a shortcut in db_sample_menu() for when you want to just display a
form on a page without needing any other business logic. We also show the log form version of this in db-sample.

Basic database reading and writing are shown in db_sample_main() and db_sample_form_submit().

Module templating has also been show in db_sample_main() and db_sample_theme() by defining a custom template to use
on that page.

A sample admin form is also available that will allow the user to customize the title that appears above the list on
/db-sample.
