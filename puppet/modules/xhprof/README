XHProf Profiler
===============

To Enable, edit the puppet/modules/apache2/templates/vhost.conf.erb file and add the following lines:

php_value auto_prepend_file /vagrant/puppet/modules/xhprof/files/xhprof_header.php
php_value auto_append_file /vagrant/puppet/modules/xhprof/files/xhprof_footer.php

Reprovision the box and this will enable xhprof to profile the website. 

DO NOT LEAVE THIS HERE OR COMMIT THESE CHANGES. While xhprof is not really detrimental to the running
of a site, unless we're profiling we don't need to set up the profiler.
